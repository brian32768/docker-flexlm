# docker-flexlm

Do you wonder who is using your ArcGIS licenses?

Is the available monitoring software too expensive? (you can just buy more ArcGIS seats
for less $!)

Do you want to run the ArcGIS license manager inside a Docker?

My goal in this project has been to get a monitor running (just a Web page).

It does this using a small app written in Python running as a service.
The Python script needs to query the license manager and it does that
using the "lmutil" command line utility.

To get a copy of that utility, the Docker contains a complete copy of
the ESRI version of Flexera flexlm.

Because Flexera FlexLM is licensed software, if you want to use this
monitor, you will need to download the Linux version of the license
manager from ESRI and put it here before doing the build.

## Future directions

* Make the web page more attractive!

## Stage 1, build the license manager

### Prerequisites

The Dockerfile is currently built using this version of the license manager:

    ArcGIS_License_Manager_Linux_2019_0_169356.tar.gz

If the version number changes you will have to change the Dockerfile.
To get the file go to my.esri.com and download the latest Linux
license manager.  It will be a file ending in 'tar.gz'. Put the file
in this folder. (The one containing the Dockerfile.)

You also need a copy of the "service.txt" file from your license
manager.  You need to edit the service.txt file so that it has the
actual license server host name instead of "This_Host".
Copy the edited file into this folder, too.

### Notes on the Dockerfile

The requirements doc at ESRI call for RHEL 6 or 7; the Dockerfile uses Centos 7.

I took the list of required packages from the ESRI documentation and
dropped them into the Dockerfile.

You'll see I broke up the package installation into multiple RUN commands. That's because
when I tried doing them in one pass, it failed. I did not try to fine tune it or confirm
which ones were really needed or what order to install them in once I got it working.

The license manager installation step is done in "silent" mode so
there is no requirement for any X Window server or any interactions
from you.

### Docker build, stage 1

Make sure you've downloaded the tar.gz file, see Prerequisites.

Then run the build command to create an image named 'flexlm'.

    docker build -t flexlm .

If the build fails with a message about not being able to COPY then
you did not put the tar.gz and/or service.txt files here. Add them and
run the build command again.  Docker will pick up where it left off
after you get the file(s) into place (Docker won't have to download
and install all the requirement files again.)

After the license manager is installed Docker will emit a long series
of Copy File and Install File messages from the flexlm installer. It
will stop at this point if the install fails.

If it succeeds it will proceed to install the Python modules needed to
run the web microservice. Finally it will say:

    Successfully tagged flexlm:latest

At this point, you will have an image file called "flexlm" with a
complete copy of the license software installed in /home/flexlm/arcgis.

### Confirm the build (optional step!)

You can look around in the new container by launching into a bash shell.
If you don't want to, skip to the next section.

    docker run -it --rm --name=lm flexlm bash

Now you're in a bash shell in the home directory of the 'flexlm' user.
You can examine install log files and things like that. You should be able
to execute the lmutil program which is in the LicenseManager/bin folder.

You can run lmutil with this command

    lmutil

The output should be all the subcommands and options for lmutil. After confirming
it works, type 'exit' to leave the Docker container.

The "--rm" will remove the container name "lm" when you exit from the shell.
If it does not then you can remove it yourself with

    docker rm lm

## Stage 2, the web monitor.

The python code and its environment were already set up in the Docker
file. Now you just have to run it. To try it out, do this:

    docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 --name=lm flexlm

Then visit the URL http://localhost:5000/ (or use your server name in place of localhost).

Now that you see it's working, presumably you want it to run forever
on a server and to survive reboots so this is the command to move to
deployment.

    docker run -d --restart always -p 5000:5000 --name=lm flexlm

You can confirm it's running, 

    docker ps
    
## Other applications for this Docker

Of course you can use this as the starting point for a Dockerised
license manager. It is already completely capable of running as a
service if you add the command to start lmgrd running. That's 2 lines
of code.

Drop me a line if you want to try it and need help.

It's much easier to set up Docker than to set up a complete, separate
RHEL 7 server to support just the one license manager application.

I previously started a Windows-based monitor and quit when I found
out how hard it was (FOR ME) to work with Docker On Windows.

That repo is still out there; I might take another crack at it someday. See
